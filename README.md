## Description

Driven by a lifelong fascination with physics that ignited at the tender age of seven through countless hours of watching science documentaries, I embarked on a journey to become a "Mad Scientist." This journey culminated in becoming a full professor of physics at Universidad Simón Bolívar in Caracas, Venezuela, in 2003.

To share this enduring passion and knowledge, I've created this repository. Its primary functions are twofold. First, I aim to foster physics education and outreach by curating and sharing diverse video resources, including YouTube segments of lectures, experiments, full-length documentaries, and animations. These resources will be complemented by book and lecture note references. Second, I provide tools and resources for algebra-based physics, designed to support high school students and independent learners. These tools include personal notes and Python notebooks for simulations, data analysis, and problem-solving.  





## Lecture Notes

**Remark** These notes are in what I would like to call: ``ehternal developement´, they come from, eithr answering questions to tutored students or my persojla notes for courses at USB. Being this the case, expect them to be incomplete and come back form time to time to seee if I have found the time to incorporate new material.


* [Math is so much fun](docs/M_is_Fun.pdf) These are simple notes on precalculus, they provide most of the tools neded for algebra based physics

* [Particle Mechanics](docs/Algebra_Based_Physics_MECHANICS.pdf) Algebra based newtonian mechanics, i.e. kinematics, Newton's laws and simple applications

* [Mecánica del Punto Material](docs/Mecanica_del_Punto_Material.pdf) [In spanish] This is a selfcontained calculus based introduction to Newtonian Mechanics
