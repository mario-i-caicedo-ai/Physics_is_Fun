## Description

Driven by a lifelong fascination with physics that ignited at the tender age of seven through countless hours of watching science documentaries, I embarked on a journey to become a "Mad Scientist." This journey culminated in becoming a full professor of physics at [Universidad Simón Bolívar](http://www.usb.ve) (USB) in Caracas, Venezuela, in 2003.

To share this enduring passion and knowledge, I've created this repository. Its primary functions are twofold. First, I aim to foster physics education and outreach by curating and sharing diverse video resources, including YouTube segments of lectures, experiments, full-length documentaries, and animations. These resources will be complemented by book and lecture note references. Second, I provide tools and resources for algebra-based physics, designed to support high school students and independent learners. These tools include personal notes and Jupyter notebooks for simulations, data analysis, and problem-solving.  





## Lecture Notes

**Remarks** 

* The lecture notes (in pdf) are in what I would like to call: ``state of ehternal developement'', they come from, either answering questions to tutored students or my personal notes for courses I teach or taught at USB. Being this the case, expect them to be incomplete and full of typos.
  * Please feel free to point out any mistakes or obscure points that you think need more clarification.
  * Come back from time to time to seee if I have found the time to incorporate new material.
* Github does not have the ability to open links in new  tabs, so you must be careful with that.
* Github has some issues opening pdf files, if they do not open just download them.
  

1 [Math is so much fun](docs/M_is_Fun.pdf) Notes on precalculus, they provide most of the tools neded for algebra based physics

2 [Particle Mechanics](docs/Algebra_Based_Newtonian_MECHANICS.pdf) Algebra based newtonian mechanics, i.e. kinematics, Newton's laws and simple applications

3 [Electromagnetism](docs/Algebra_Based_Physics_ELECTROMAGNETISM.pdf) Algebra based electromagnetism. Frome electric charge to simple circuits.

6 [Mecánica del Punto Material](docs/Mecanica_del_Punto_Material.pdf) [In spanish] This is a selfcontained calculus based introduction to Newtonian Mechanics
