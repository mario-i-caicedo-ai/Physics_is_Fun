## Description

Driven by a lifelong fascination or better said, love, for physics that ignited at the tender age of seven through countless hours of watching science documentaries, I embarked on a journey to become a "Mad Scientist." This journey culminated with [me](https://sites.google.com/view/marioicaicedo) becoming a Full Professor of physics at [Universidad Simón Bolívar](http://www.usb.ve) (USB) in Caracas, Venezuela, in 2003. I in 2016 after almost thirty years of teaching and research, I semi retired (meaning that I still lecture advanced courses to USB graduate students of physics).

To share this enduring passion for science in general and physics in particular, I am creating (please note my emphasis in the present continuos tense) this repository. I gladly invite you to explore these resources freely and embark on your own physics journey

This is what you will find in this repo. 

*  Lecture notes on different topics of physics and math, I am making every possible effort to mantain the text free from calculus, or as many people say, the notes are non calculus physics.
*  I aim to foster physics education and outreach by linking to diverse video resources, including YouTube segments of lectures, experiments, full-length documentaries, and animations.
*  Also in my plans I wish to create and freely share Python codes in Jupyter notebooks for simulations, data analysis, and problem-solving.  


## Lecture Notes

**Remarks** 

* The lecture notes (in pdf) are in what I would like to call: ``state of ehternal developement'', they come from, either answering questions to tutored students or from my personal notes for courses I teach or have taught at USB. Being this the case, expect them to be incomplete and full of typos.
  * Please feel free to point out any mistakes or obscure points that you think need more clarification.
  * Come back from time to time to seee if I have found the time to incorporate new material.
* Github does not have the ability to open links in new  tabs, so please be careful and choose open in new tab when necessary.
* Github has some issues opening pdf files, if one such a file does not open just download it (downloading will always work).

  

1 [Algebra Based Physics: Mechanics](docs/Algebra_Based_Physics_MECHANICS.pdf) Algebra based newtonian mechanics. Kinematics, Newton's laws and simple applications

2 [Algebra Based Physics: Electromagnetism](docs/Algebra_Based_Physics_ELECTROMAGNETISM.pdf) For the moment these lecture notes are limited to some elementary circuit theory.

[Math is so much fun](docs/M_is_Fun.pdf) Notes on precalculus, they provide many of the tools needed for algebra based physics


6 [Mecánica del Punto Material](docs/Mecanica_del_Punto_Material.pdf) This is a selfcontained calculus based introduction to Newtonian Mechanics which , for the moment is available in spanish only. My plan for the months to come is to ask the help of one of my friends Gemini, Meta AI, Claude (all the Generative AI's) to translate the book to english
